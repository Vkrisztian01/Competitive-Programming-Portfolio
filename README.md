# Algorithmic Challenges from the CSES Problem Set and More

### Overview

This portfolio showcases a collection of algorithmic challenges I have tackled, mostly from the ****CSES Problem Set****. The aim of this repository is to demonstrate my ****Algorithmic Problem Solving**** skills and the methology I use for my Competitive Programming training. Additionally, the viewer will find a selection of ****Advanced Problems****, primarily drawn from Codeforces to illustrate the complexity of the different topics in competitions.

### Problem Categories

Advanced Problems  
Sorting and Searching  
Dynamic Programming  
Graph and Tree Algorithms  
Range Queries  
Mathematics    
Geometry   

### Additional Clarification for the Viewer

Most of the problems are picked from the CSES Problem Set. Note that all solutions in this repository are written using ****C++**** syntax. Inside the solutions, the viewer may find the name of the problem as well as links to the website. Although the solutions are primarily written in English, some of them may feature Hungarian names for variables or functions. I have not addressed this issue, as I believe it reflects my evolving coding style.
